(Q1) What is Transfer Learning?
(A)Transfer learning makes use of the knowledge gained while solving one problem and applying it to a different but related problem.
   For example, knowledge gained while learning to recognize cars can be used to some extent to recognize trucks.
(Q2) What is pretrained model?
(A)In computer vision, transfer learning is usually expressed through the use of pre-trained models. 
   A pre-trained model is a model that is trained on a large benchmark dataset to solve a problem similar to the one that we want to solve.
(Q3)What is imagenet database? How many images and classes are there in that data?
(A)ImageNet is a large dataset of annotated photographs intended for computer vision research.
   The goal of developing the dataset was to provide a resource to promote the research and development of improved methods for computer vision.
   Based on statistics about the dataset recorded on ImageNet,
   there are a little more than 14 million images in the dataset, a little more than 21 thousand groups or classes (synsets), 
   and a little more than 1 million images that have bounding box annotations (e.g. boxes around identified objects in the images).
(Q4)What are the different pretrained models available on imagenet?
(A) It has the following models ( as of Keras version 2.1.2 ):
   1. VGG16,
   2. InceptionV3,
   3. ResNet,
   4. MobileNet,
   5. Xception,
   6. InceptionResNetV2
